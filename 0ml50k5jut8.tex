\begin{equation}
h^f() = h^f_{ref} -(T-T_{ref})c_p^f = 0 - 4.186*  C^\circ   
\end{equation}
where \(h_{ref}^f=0\) and \(T_{ref} = 273.16\, K^\circ\) so that temperature is now measured in centigrades.
At the same time for \(g\) is 
\begin{equation}
h^g( ) = 2.26  - 1.996 C^\circ
\end{equation}
and therefore:
\begin{equation}
h^g()-h^f() = 
\end{equation}
